PHSX815_Project1

The project is composed of two parts.
1. Generating data from Gaussian hypotheses and analyzing them to get false negative rate and generate plots for LLR distributions
2. Calculating minimum number of measurements needed to get false negative rate below a fixed threshold and calculating variation of number of measurements with standard deviation.

<b>Structure and Contents</b>

1. `./outputs/`: Contains all the output files generated - plots, random number dumps, data for generating plots
2. `gaussian_analyzer_generator_driver.py`: Contains driver to run generating gaussian data, dumping it in file and then loading it from the file and then analyzing it. Just a simple wrapper for drivers from `generate_data_driver.py` and `plot_hypothesis.py`.
3. `generate_data_driver.py`: Contains all definitions such as mean of null hypothesis, mean of test hypothesis, standard deviation, number of experiments, number of measurements (per experiment), sigma range (for second part), alpha, beta. These definitions are then exported everywhere else in the code so modify definitions in this file to modify any of these parameters. Draws random samples and dumps it into `./outputs/rawdraw_0.txt` and `./outputs/rawdraw_1.txt` (one for each hypothesis)
4. `analyze_data.py`: Loads dump from `generate_data_driver.py` and analyzes the data to generate histogram for log likelihood ratio and calculate the false negative rate. The histogram is stored in `./outputs/analyzed_data.png`. 
5. `min_n_variation_driver.py`: Contains driver that takes in a range of standard deviation (defined in `generate_data_driver.py`) and generates number of measurements needed to get false negative rate below a threshold (also defined in `generate_data_driver.py`). Just a wrapper around `get_min_n_fnr.py` and `analyze_min_n_fnr.py`. Saves the plot of number of measurements vs standard deviation to `./outputs/n_sigma_variation.png`.
6. `get_min_n_fnr.py`: Takes in range of standard deviation and calculates minimum number of measurments needed to get false negative ratio below a threshold. Dumps list of pairs of number of measurements and standard deviations into `./outputs/n_sigma_variation.txt`.
7. `analyze_min_n_fnr.py`: Loads pair of number of measurements and standard deviations from `./outputs/n_sigma_variation.txt` and generates plot. Saves the plot in `./outputs/n_sigma_variation.png`.
8. `file_list_utils.py`: Contains functions to load and write lists to and from txt files simpler. Also supports multidimensional lists.
9. `histogram_utils.py`: File contains `get_histogram_data()` which takes in measurements and number of samples and first generates a histogram using numpy (but doesn't plot it) and then returns a 2-d list of bins and probability at each bin which is used to plot. I had to implement this since MatPlotLib's histogram was slow for 1,000,000+ experiments.
10. `perf_wrapper.py`: A basic wrapper to measure performance of functions. Not currently used anywhere.

<b>Part 1: Generating data from Gaussian hypotheses and analyzing them to get false negative rate and generate plots for LLR distributions</b><br/>
To run the code for this part, type `python3 gaussian_analyzer_generator_driver.py`. <br/>
`gaussian_analyzer_generator_driver.py` has a two functions. 
<br/><br/>a. `generate_data_driver()` draws n_experiments samples from normal distribution with defined means and standard deviation and exports raw data to `rawdraw_0.txt` (null hypothesis) and `rawdraw_1.txt` (test hypothesis). These export files are located in `./outputs` directory
<br/><br/>b. `plot_hypothesis()` analyzes the raw data generated, calculates the LLR distributions and also calculates false negative rate. The plot generated by this driver is stored in `./outputs/analyzed_data.png`.

<b>Part 2: Calculating minimum number of measurements needed to get false negative rate below a fixed threshold and calculating variation of number of measurements with standard deviation</b><br/>
To run the code for this part, type `python3 min_n_variation_driver.py`. <br/>
`min_n_variation_driver.py` also has two functions
<br/><br/>a. `write_min_n_variation_driver()` calculates the minimum number of measurements for a range of standard deviations which get the false negative rate below a threshold. The function lacks in performance (since it has to draw a lot of samples for each number of measurement iteration) so I'll recommend decreasing `N_experiments` in `generate_data.py`. Each pair of number of measurements and standard deviation is written to `./outputs/n_sigma_variation.txt`.
<br/><br/>b. `n_std_variation_plot_driver()` loads the number of measurements and standard deviation pair from `./outputs/n_sigma_variation.txt` and plots them in a graph which is saved in `./outputs/n_sigma_variation.png`.
