PHSX815_Project1

The project is composed of two parts.
1. Generating data from Gaussian hypotheses and analyzing them to get false negative rate and generate plots for LLR distributions
2. Calculating minimum number of measurements needed to get false negative rate below a fixed threshold and calculating variation of number of measurements with standard deviation.

<b>Note</b>:
All definitions such as mean of null hypothesis, mean of test hypothesis, standard deviation, number of experiments, number of measurements (per experiment), sigma range (for second part), alpha, beta are in generate_data.py. These definitions are then exported everywhere else in the code so modify definitions in generate_data.py to modify any of these parameters.

<b>Part 1: Generating data from Gaussian hypotheses and analyzing them to get false negative rate and generate plots for LLR distributions</b><br/>
To run the code for this part, type `python3 gaussian_analyzer_generator_driver.py`. <br/>
`gaussian_analyzer_generator_driver.py` has a two functions. 
<br/><br/>a. `generate_data_driver()` draws n_experiments samples from normal distribution with defined means and standard deviation and exports raw data to `rawdraw_0.txt` (null hypothesis) and `rawdraw_1.txt` (test hypothesis). These export files are located in `./outputs` directory
<br/><br/>b. `plot_hypothesis()` analyzes the raw data generated, calculates the LLR distributions and also calculates false negative rate. The plot generated by this driver is stored in `./outputs/analyzed_data.png`.

<b>Part 2: Calculating minimum number of measurements needed to get false negative rate below a fixed threshold and calculating variation of number of measurements with standard deviation</b><br/>
To run the code for this part, type `python3 min_n_variation_driver.py`. <br/>
`min_n_variation_driver.py` also has two functions
<br/><br/>a. `write_min_n_variation_driver()` calculates the minimum number of measurements for a range of standard deviations which get the false negative rate below a threshold. The function lacks in performance (since it has to draw a lot of samples for each number of measurement iteration) so I'll recommend decreasing `N_experiments` in `generate_data.py`. Each pair of number of measurements and standard deviation is written to `./outputs/n_sigma_variation.txt`.
<br/><br/>b. `n_std_variation_plot_driver()` loads the number of measurements and standard deviation pair from `./outputs/n_sigma_variation.txt` and plots them in a graph which is saved in `./outputs/n_sigma_variation.png`.
